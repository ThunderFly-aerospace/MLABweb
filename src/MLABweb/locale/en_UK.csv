"mlab_what_is_text","MLAB is an open-source eletronic building kit for scientists and engineers."
"Modular","Modularity"
"Modular_text","A complicated construction is disassembled into elementary modules containing only so many components so they can perform their function in a system. Such concept enables a fast development of new devices and their subsequent acquisition of new features. Modules are assembled on a base made of aerial duralumin, so the resulting construction is robust and quite compact."

"cooper_1","There are still many things worth of improving or inventing. Enthusiastic people are always in shortage. Do you want to contribute to the development?"
"cooper_2_title","I have my own module that I want to share with others."
"cooper_2","Even though MLAB is an open-source concept, it is not possible to add a new module without complying with a convention. Therefore it is a good idea to read a few words about how to design <a href='http://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=en:rules'>a good MLAB module.</a>"
"cooper_3_title","I would love to contribute, but I don't have any ideas."
"cooper_3","We still have a plenty of ideas and are ready to share them. Simply choose from <a href='http://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=en:todo'>our wiki.</a>"
"cooper_4_title","I don't know how to develop modules"
"cooper_4","There is no need to be ashamed - do not hesitate to contact us. We will seek to find a common goal. The biggest mistake would be not to try."
